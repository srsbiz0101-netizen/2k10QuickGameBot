you can run this any time after you start NBA2k10 in RPSC3. it will use OCR to look for the screen that appears at the end of the game, then go to quick game, randomize both teams, and start a CPUvCPU game. It also logs stats as a long single line, so you can use the text document to set up a sports ticker at the bottom of your stream with a text source.
